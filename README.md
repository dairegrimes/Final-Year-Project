# Final Year Project
## Multi-Factor Authentication System

This project addresses the need and demand for more secure electronic devices. Customers want more security with their electronic devices, but expect it to be fast and user friendly.  
 
The work investigates techniques directed towards making computers more secure by adding multi-factor authentication within a Windows 10 environment. The security is split into two parts. The first part is during the login process. The user must provide biometrical and token authentication alongside the password. The second part is based on an additional authentication process that ensures that the system self-locks while the user leaves the PC and unlocks using facial recognition when the user returns.
